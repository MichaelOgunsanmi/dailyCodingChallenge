# Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊
# n/2 ⌋ times.
#
# You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [3,2,3]
# Output: 3
# Example 2:
#
# Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        majorCount = len(nums) / 2
        hashMap = {}

        for num in nums:
            hashMap[num] = hashMap.get(num, 0) + 1
            if hashMap[num] > majorCount:
                return num
